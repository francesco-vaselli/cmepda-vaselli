Introduction
============
This is a repository for the exam assignment of the Computing Methods for Experimental Physics and Data Analysis course. In particular, this documentation is a newbie attempt to create something readable using Sphinx and read the docs.

The full project description along with some simulated dataset are hosted `here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fVC-odmFAtfNIg0lHG8uCg7vBsnjv9YS?usp=sharing>`_ due to the size of the data.

Exploring and getting to know the GitHub environment and its features. Also, passing the exam.


Limitations
